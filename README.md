# Digital Maths and Programming - Assignment 1 
### Music manager
By Isaac Stewart, Student number: 468639

This is a small program for Assignment 1 of the DMP unit. This program aims to meet all of the requirements in the rubric and demonstrate the elements of python that we have been using in recent lectures.  

This program allows simple creating of playlists, that can then have songs added to them which are manually input by the user.  
The user can create accounts that will have their own playlists, and features such as password hashing are incorporated to increase security.  
Admin accounts can be used to manage the users stored in the users.json file. 

#### References and my useage of AI

I used AI to build on my existing knowledge of Python and make writing the code easier and faster. 
I made use of the built in GitHub Copilot inside Visual Studio Code to assist me with creating this program. I used the autocomplete feature to quickly finish typing out sections of code, and used the inline chat to quickly edit sections of code for me, with my instruction. I also used the chat tab to consult on how my program was looking, and as a tool to check my code and make sure I was doing everything right.

Along with my own knowledge, I used W3Schools to help fill in the gaps when I was not sure how to develop certain features.
