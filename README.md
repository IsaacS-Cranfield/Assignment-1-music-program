This is a small program for Assignment 1 of the DMP unit. This program aims to meet all of the requirements in the rubric and demonstrate the elements of python that we have been using in recent lectures.  

This program allows simple creating of playlists, that can then have songs added to them which are manually input by the user.  
The user can create accounts that will have their own playlists, and features such as password hashing are incorporated to increase security.  
Admin accounts can be used to manage the users stored in the users.json file.
